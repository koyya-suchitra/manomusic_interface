🎶 ###Hand Gesture-Based Music Control Interface### 🎶
This project is an interactive music control system powered by computer vision and hand gesture recognition using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The system allows users to control music playback seamlessly through intuitive hand gestures, leveraging the capabilities of a webcam for real-time detection.
🚀 Features:
-Play/Pause Music: Use a simple thumbs up to resume music and thumbs down to pause.
-Volume Control: Point your index finger up to increase volume or down to decrease it.
-Favorites Management: Form a heart shape gesture with both hands to add songs to favorites or cross your hands in an "X" shape to remove them.
-Gesture to Stop Music: Make a "V" shape with your index and middle fingers to stop the music and exit the application.
-Real-Time Hand Tracking: Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection and tracking.
🛠️ Technologies Used:
-Python for logic and integration.
-OpenCV for real-time video capture and processing.
-MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition.
-Pygame for seamless music playback and volume control.
🎯 How It Works:
-Webcam Input: The system uses your webcam to capture video frames.
-Gesture Detection: Hand gestures are detected using MediaPipe's hand tracking model. Specific gestures trigger various music control actions.
-Music Interaction: Control playback, adjust volume, and manage your favorite songs with just the movement of your hands.
💡 Use Cases:
-Touchless Control: Control music without touching your device — perfect for multitasking or hands-free environments.
-Interactive Installations: Enhance interactive art/music installations by adding gesture-based music control.
-Fun Projects: A fun project for tech enthusiasts looking to explore computer vision and human-computer interaction!
